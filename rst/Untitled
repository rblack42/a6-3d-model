Programming a Model Airplane
############################

After a long career in the USAF, followed by another long career teaching
Computer Science, I have finally retired! With much more free time onmy hands,
I have now managed to reactivate my old hobbies. One of my favorite, and the
one that helped me become an Aerospace Engineer, is building and flying model
airplanes. I tend to focus on free flight models, airplanes that, once
launched, must find their own way up into the sky, and, hopefully, back to
Earth! (That usually involves some chasing if done outdoors, but there is also
a class of model airplanes flown indoors. These are fascinating, since they are
insanely light, and fly for a long time on a wound up rubber motor (think very
long rubber band!)

Most of the models I have built have been designed by someone else, and that someone produced plans which were used to build replicas of the original design. Modelers cut pieces out of sheets of Balsa wood and glue them together to construct the airframe. Doing that properly is essential to getting the craft to behave when it is launched into the air!

But suppose you have no plan and want to come up with a design of your own. There are a variety of CAD programs that modelers can use to come up with their own plans. The big problem with these programs is that sometimes they are very expensive, and all the time, they require a fairly steep learning curve to master. Then ther is the problem that most plans will not print on "normal" home printers. You need to wander to someplace like a FedEx office that has large format printers available.

If you manage yo get your plan printed, ther is still the problem of visualizing your design, and figuring out al of the required materials that will be needed to build the airplane.

That is a lot of work, and it leaves me wondering if there is a better way, one that any modeler with a home computer and printer can use to get an airplane constructed.

Describing the Model
********************

Model Airplanes can be broken down into several major components, commonly found on all airplanes, even those you climb into yourself:

	* Fuselage - the main body which usually lives in the center of the airplane.

	* Wing - the main lifting surface. (There may be mor that one!)

	* Rudder - a vertical surface that controls turning.vvcccchkfuvdnngkhcibkvffctkrifciekikrelifgdb
